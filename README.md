# GoShellRun üêö

This repository is a simple Golang HTTP server designed to allow for the remote
execution of shell commands.

It was originally designed to automate deployment workflows via webhooks.

## Installation and Use

Compile the binary with `go build` for your operating system of choice. Then send the binary to your server:

```terminal
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build .
$ scp ./go-shell-run ubuntu@12.345.67.89:/home/harrison
```

Run the binary on an open port of your choosing and pass it your API key:

```terminal
$ ssh ubuntu@12.345.67.89
$ ./go-shell-run --port=3012 --token=abc
```

You can now pass arbitrary shell commands to the server by POSTing them to the `/jobs` endpoint.

```
$ curl --location --request POST 'http://12.345.67.89:3012/status' \
--header 'token: abc' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jobs": [
        "pwd",
        "ls -la",
    ]
}'
```

If the server is already executing the jobs it'll return a 503, if not, you'll
recieve a JSON response.

## Running as a Service

The `/resources` folder contains a service manifest that you could use to turn this
binary into a service controlled by `systemctl`, so that the server is
persistent even across command failures.

Copy this file to your `/etc/systemd/system` directory and restart your system
manager.
